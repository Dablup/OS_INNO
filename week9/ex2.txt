To increase a hit ratio we can use such sequence as: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
Since there are a lot of recurring values, we will hit much more often.

Result fo this sequence(for number of pageFrames bigger than 8):
Hits: 8
Misses: 8
Ratio hits to misses: 1.000000




To decrease a hit ratio we can use such sequence as: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
Since there are only different values, we will miss everytime.

Result for this sequence:
Hits: 0
Misses: 13
Ratio hits to misses: 0.000000
